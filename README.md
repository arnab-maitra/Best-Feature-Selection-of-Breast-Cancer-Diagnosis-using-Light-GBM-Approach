# Best Feature Selection of Breast Cancer Diagnosis using Light Gradient Boost (LGBoost) Approach

## Introduction

This repository contains the implementation of our thesis project titled **"Best Feature Selection of Breast Cancer Diagnosis using Light Gradient Boost (LGBoost) Approach"**. The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant using the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) algorithm. This project is carried out under the supervision of Mrs. Vedatrayee Chatterjee, Assistant Professor at Asansol Engineering College, and is part of the requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering.

## Motivation

Breast cancer is a life-threatening disease affecting millions of individuals worldwide. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of breast cancer diagnosis.

## Project Description

The project involves the analysis of a diagnostic dataset containing 30 feature columns and approximately 570 rows. The primary goals are:
- To identify common characteristics that distinguish benign from malignant cases.
- To generate heatmap visualizations to identify and eliminate redundant features.
- To develop a highly accurate machine learning model using the LightGBM algorithm.

## Algorithms and Models

The following machine learning algorithms were explored and compared in this project:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Gradient Boosting Algorithm**
- **Random Forest Algorithm**
- **XGBoost Algorithm**
- **LightGBM Algorithm**

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project was collected from the Kaggle repository. It contains diagnostic features of breast cancer cases.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, normalizing data, and feature selection.
2. **Model Training**: Training various machine learning models on the dataset.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Comparing the performance of different models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. **Visualization**: Using swarm plots and heatmaps to visualize feature importance and data distribution.

## Results

The LightGBM algorithm outperformed other models in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Detailed experimental results and visualizations are provided in the thesis document.

## Conclusion

The project demonstrates that the LightGBM algorithm is an effective tool for breast cancer diagnosis. The model developed in this project can assist in early and accurate diagnosis, thereby improving patient outcomes.

## Future Work

Future work involves exploring other machine learning techniques and larger datasets to further improve the model's accuracy and robustness.
