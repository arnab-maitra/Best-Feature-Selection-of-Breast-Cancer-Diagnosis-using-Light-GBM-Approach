# Best Feature Selection of Breast Cancer Diagnosis using Light Gradient Boost (LGBoost) Approach

## Introduction

Today, Breast cancer is affecting individuals, particularly women. According to the World Health Organization (WHO). It's a leading cause of female mortality. Around a million women succumb to breast cancer annually with India's fatality rate at 13.92%. The prevalence is higher in Australia, Europe and the US, while Malaysia observes later-stage presentations. Regular screening is vital due to asymptomatic cases. Early detection aids treatment and survival. Contributing factors include family history, obesity, radiation exposure, and genetics. Recently discovered, breast cancer is categorized as malignant or benign. Analyzing tumor characteristics helps differentiate them. Benign tumors are low-risk, while malignant ones spread to neighboring tissues and the body. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being employed to classify breast cancer. AI algorithms train on datasets to label tumors as 1 for benign or 0 for malignant.

## Motivation

The initial aim of this study is to examine breast cancer data derived from a diagnostic dataset comprising 30 feature columns and approximately 570 rows. The primary goal is to identify common characteristics in these groups that distinguish benign cases from malignant ones effectively. Subsequently, we plan to generate a heatmap visualization to identify and eliminate redundant features from the dataset. Finally, our ultimate objective is to create a machine learning model that enables users to classify breast cancer cases as either benign or malignant accurately. By accomplishing these objectives, we hope to enhance the diagnostic process and contribute to more efficient and precise breast cancer classification.

Our project aims to address challenges and propose solutions to enhance accuracy in breast cancer classification. Accuracy is a critical factor, as an imprecise model can lead to suboptimal outcomes. The report primarily centers around improving the accuracy of various algorithms, namely Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting Algorithm, Random Forest Algorithm (Octaviani and Z Rustam et al.) [4], XG Boost Algorithm, and Light GBM Algorithm. The objective is to achieve the highest possible accuracy for the model by Light GBM algorithms. By tackling accuracy-related issues, we aspire to provide more reliable and effective breast cancer classification results.
