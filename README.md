# Best Feature Selection of Breast Cancer Diagnosis using Light Gradient Boost (LGBoost) Approach

## Introduction

Today, Breast cancer is affecting individuals, particularly women. According to the World Health Organization (WHO). It's a leading cause of female mortality. Around a million women succumb to breast cancer annually with India's fatality rate at 13.92%. The prevalence is higher in Australia, Europe and the US, while Malaysia observes later-stage presentations. Regular screening is vital due to asymptomatic cases. Early detection aids treatment and survival. Contributing factors include family history, obesity, radiation exposure, and genetics. Recently discovered, breast cancer is categorized as malignant or benign. Analyzing tumor characteristics helps differentiate them. Benign tumors are low-risk, while malignant ones spread to neighboring tissues and the body. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being employed to classify breast cancer. AI algorithms train on datasets to label tumors as 1 for benign or 0 for malignant.
